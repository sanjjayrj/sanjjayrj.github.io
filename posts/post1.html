                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project involved leveraging deep learning techniques to detect craters on the lunar surface using satellite imagery. 
                        It utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and was built as part of a research initiative for lunar mapping.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Features</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data preparation of 900+ images that were acquired from the official ISRO website.</li>
                        <li>Each image captured by the OHRC (Optical High Resolution Camera) that had 1M pixels were cropped into many images that covered 120meter square each.</li>
                        <li>Data preprocessing with advanced augmentation techniques.</li>
                        <li>Custom CNN model for object detection and classification.</li>
                        <li>Achieved a detection accuracy of over 92% on test datasets.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python, TensorFlow, Keras</li>
                        <li>NumPy, OpenCV, PDS4</li>
                        <li>VS Code, RoboFlow</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
                    <p>
                        One major challenge was the enormous size of the each image. So, for the dataset, as smaller craters were underrepresented. 
                        Techniques like oversampling and data augmentation proved crucial in addressing this issue.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project resulted in a journal publication and was recognized as an innovative application of AI in space exploration.
