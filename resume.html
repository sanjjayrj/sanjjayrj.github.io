                <h1>My Resume</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology specializing in Data Science.
                    I'm passionate aboute AI and am always upto learn new things. My contributions to impactful projects include crater detection on the lunar surface which was published in a journal recently, as well as the recent supply chain case studies on Walmart, Amazon as well as Barilla SpA.
                    Some of my key skills include Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.
                    I'll shortly be graduating and am looking for opportunities in the field of Data Science.
                    Go look at my projects and blogs to know more about my work.
